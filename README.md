In today's era , every second student seeks for a coaching institute for the better understanding of his syllabus. There are many coaching institutes around you. But how many do you remember? Don't think too much. You might be knowing hardly 3 or 4 renowned institutes. Is that all do we have. No. We have a number of coaching institutes in a city. Then what's the reason that they are unrecognised, or are hardly known in their own locality? So what is the reason that some institutes despite of teaching better then the renowned coachings,they are not having the recognition among the students?


The main reason is that they are in an "UNBRANDED ECOSYSTEM". They do not have a brand name linked to them and thus students are very less familier with them. The main motive of our project is to convert those institutes from an "UNBRANDED ECOSYSTEM" to a "BRANDED ECOSYSTEM". The business model used is known as "AGGREGATOR BUSINESS MODEL". In this business model, we will give our brand name to the institutes so that they will get a big hike in name and recognition.


Another thing is, today, 90 percent of the students comes from a middle class family.Thus they are the people who cannot afford high fees of big coaching institutes. Only 10 percent of students are able to pay the fees of such institutes.Does it means that 90 percent students becomes ineligible for the quality education? No. Absolutely No. Everyone deserves to get a quality education irrespective of the fees. Thus we focuses on three major points
1. Quality Education
2. Low Fees
3. Delightful student experience
